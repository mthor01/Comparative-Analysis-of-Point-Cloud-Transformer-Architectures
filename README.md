# Point Cloud Transformer Comparison

This project is a reimplementation and adaptation of four Point Cloud Transformer models.\
Each model's implementation and training instructions are provided in the `Adapted Code` directory in their respective `README.md` files.

## Implementations

- **Point Transformer**, **Point Transformer v3**, and **OctFormer**: Located in the `pointcept` directory.
- **Superpoint Transformer**: Located in the `Superpoint_Transformer` directory.

## Dataset

All models were trained and evaluated on the **S3DIS** dataset.

## Evaluation

- Results and evaluation scripts are available in the `Plots` directory.

- To run the evaluation scripts, install dependencies using:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Generated plots will be saved to: `Plots/output`
